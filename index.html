	<p>Welcome to my page on Cuban cuisine!  Here are images and short descriptions of typical Cuban food enjoyed by those of us who have grown up in Miami.  I've not found a lot of this food in Northern California so I've created this page to give my friends "a taste" of this fabulous food!</p>

		<h4>Another Site</h4>
		<p><a href="http://www.tasteofcuba.com/cubanrecipes.html">Here's another site</a> with information about Cuban food.  My first impression of this site was that it is terribly outdated.  It was created in 2001 and looking at the restaurants tab, it looks like it was updated in 2015.  However, it appears that only some content was updated.  The overall style of the page still looks pretty old.  The content is easy to find and the site is easy to navigate. It is also very comprehensive, and includes an extensive library of Cuban recipes.  I am not sure how accurate the information in the restaurants page is at this point.  Looking at the code, it is evident that the creator of the site included lots of meta keywords when the site was first created.  These keywords are no longer used by search engines as they were before. Other things that I think could be improved on this site include images and fonts.  Both would benefit from being sharper and I'd love to see a more creative font on the page.  It seems that a lot of tables were used to create this site.  I'm not sure why. Finally, I ran the code through the html validator and it found 35 errors in the code while running it as HTML 4.01 Transitional (something which the code validator did automatically).</p>
